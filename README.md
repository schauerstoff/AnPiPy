# AnPiPy
A program to simplify the process of adding pictures to Anki flashcards. 

One will still need to choose the picture and paste it to the correct field in Anki bc I don't know yet how to access Anki directly. However, it a lot safer that way because it's still you who messes with the Anki database.
This is designed to be used with vocabulary flashcards, who need to be exported to an xlsx file by the user as well. I'll try to find a way to automate that as well in the future.
